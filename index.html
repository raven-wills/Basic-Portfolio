        <p>There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of
            all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky.
            I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever
            done to you? I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I
            like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening
            doors!
        </p>

        <p> You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone.
            That's the curse of the Time Lords. Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... There was a war. A Time War. The Last
            Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost.
            Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time. It
            is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that
            makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York.</p>
