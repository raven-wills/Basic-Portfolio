            <p> I am a formally educated anthropologist, now full-stack web developer trained at the UT Coding Boot Camp. I’ve
                always been interested in the impact technology can have on our society, especially when it comes to accessibility.
                It's important to me that my projects are inclusive, particularly for the most marginalized in a community.
                Anthropologists believe that people share wants and needs that transcend cultural divides. I plan to use
                my knowledge of these wants and needs to build tools that deliver on both form and function.
